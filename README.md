# SIDReasoner

This is the code implementation for **"SIDReasoner - Reasoning over Semantic IDs Enhances Generative Recommendation"**.

SIDReasoner is a generative recommendation framework that strengthens generative recommenders with reasoning ability over semantic IDs. This repository provides:

- A complete training pipeline, with each training stage integrated into an easy-to-run script.
- Full training data, including our synthesized enriched alignment corpus.
- Pretrained model checkpoints. (Coming soon.)

Our method demonstrates that, with improved SID–language alignment, effective recommendation reasoning can be achieved even under academic-scale training. By open-sourcing the pipeline, data, and checkpoints, we aim to facilitate further research on reasoning in generative recommendation.

## Environments

The reinforcement learning stage (Stage 3) in this project is built on top of VERL. We recommend follow the [official installation guide](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html#requirements) to set up the environment. To execute the codes correctly, the following additional packages are required:

- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `peft`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `fire`
- `wandb`
- `tqdm`
- `accelerate`
- `bitsandbytes`


## Dataset

The datasets can be accessed via this [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/heyingzhi/SIDReasoner_Amazon). Please download the dataset and ensure the dataset folder is placed under directory ./data/Amazon .

## Training

SIDReasoner follows a three-stage training pipeline.

| Stage | Script | 
| --- | --- | 
| Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning | `bash sft_Qwen3_enrich.sh` | 
| Stage 2: Reasoning Activation | `bash sft_reasoning_activation.sh` |
| Stage 3: RL Training | `bash RL_training_script.sh` |

### Run training

```bash
# Stage 1
bash sft_Qwen3_enrich.sh

# Stage 2
bash sft_reasoning_activation.sh

# Stage 3
bash RL_training_script.sh
```

The training logs are written to `./logs`.

## Evaluation

We provide the scripts to test the model performance under thinking and non-thinking mode:

```bash
# Non-thinking mode.
bash evaluate_Qwen3.sh

# Thinking mode.
bash evaluate_Qwen3_think.sh
```

### Stage 3 checkpoint merge

The reasoning evaluation script expects a merged Hugging Face checkpoint named `actor_merged`. If RL training has only produced raw `actor` folders, merge them first:

```bash
python3 ./scripts/merge_fsdp_checkpoint.py \
  --checkpoint ./checkpoints/RecRL_Reasoning/Office_Products_stage3_rl_Qwen3-1.7B/global_step_100/actor \
  --output-dir ./checkpoints/RecRL_Reasoning/Office_Products_stage3_rl_Qwen3-1.7B/global_step_100/actor_merged
```
